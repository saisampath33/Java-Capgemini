1. Employee Salary System

Create a Java application for an organization where different employees have different salary calculations.
Define a base class Employee with a method calculateSalary().
Create subclasses like Developer, Manager, and Intern that override the method.
Use runtime polymorphism to calculate salaries without knowing the employee type in advance.

2. Payment Processing Application

Design a payment system that supports multiple payment methods.
Create an interface or abstract class Payment with a method pay().
Implement this method in classes such as CreditCardPayment, DebitCardPayment, and UPIPayment.
Demonstrate polymorphism by processing payments using a single reference type.

3. Online Notification System

Develop a notification system that sends alerts through different channels.
Create a base class Notification with a method send().
Extend it with classes like EmailNotification, SMSNotification, and PushNotification.
Use polymorphism to send notifications dynamically based on user preference.

4. Vehicle Rental System

Create a Java program for a vehicle rental service.
Define a base class Vehicle with a method calculateRent().
Create subclasses Car, Bike, and Truck with different rent calculations.
Use a base class reference to calculate rental charges for different vehicles.

5. Banking Interest Calculator

Design a banking system that calculates interest differently for various account types.
Create a base class BankAccount with a method calculateInterest().
Extend it into SavingsAccount, FixedDepositAccount, and CurrentAccount.
Use runtime polymorphism to calculate interest.

6. Media Player Application

Create a media player that can play different types of media files.
Define a base class MediaFile with a method play().
Create subclasses such as AudioFile, VideoFile, and Podcast.
Use polymorphism to play media files using a single reference.

7. E-Commerce Discount System

Design a Java program for an e-commerce platform where discounts vary by customer type.
Create a base class Customer with a method calculateDiscount().
Extend it with RegularCustomer, PremiumCustomer, and VIPCustomer.
Use polymorphism to apply discounts dynamically.

8. Restaurant Billing System

Create a billing system for a restaurant.
Define a base class MenuItem with a method calculatePrice().
Create subclasses such as VegItem and NonVegItem that override the method.
Use polymorphism to generate the final bill.

9. Game Character Behavior

Design a game where different characters attack differently.
Create a base class Character with a method attack().
Extend it into classes like Warrior, Archer, and Mage.
Use polymorphism to perform attacks without knowing the character type.
