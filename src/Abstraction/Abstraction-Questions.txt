1. A company is developing an online payment system that supports different payment methods such as Credit Card, UPI, and Net Banking.

   Create an abstract class Payment
   It should contain:
       . an abstract method processPayment(double amount)
       . a concrete method printReceipt()
   Create subclasses CreditCardPayment, UPIPayment, and NetBankingPayment
   Each subclass should implement the payment processing logic
   Demonstrate abstraction by processing payments using a Payment reference

2: Ride Booking Application

  A ride booking app offers different ride types such as Bike, Auto, and Car.
  Create an abstract class Ride
  Include:
   . abstract method calculateFare(int distance)
   . concrete method rideDetails()
  Create classes BikeRide, AutoRide, and CarRide
  Each ride type calculates fare differently
  Use abstraction to calculate fares dynamically

3. Banking System

  A bank provides different account types such as Savings Account and Current Account.
  Create an abstract class BankAccount
  Include:
     . abstract method calculateInterest()
     . concrete methods deposit() and withdraw()
  Implement SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount
  Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using abstraction

4. Employee Management System

  An organization has full-time and part-time employees.
  Create an abstract class Employee
  Include:
     . abstract method calculateSalary()
     . concrete method displayDetails()
  Implement FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee
  Salary calculation logic should differ for each employee type

5. Food Delivery Application


  A food delivery app supports multiple restaurants with different preparation times.
  Create an abstract class Restaurant
  Include:
      . abstract method prepareFood()
      . concrete method orderReceived()
  Implement FastFoodRestaurant and FineDiningRestaurant
  Demonstrate abstraction when preparing food orders
