Exceptional Handling

Abnormal situation/Unexpected Problem which disturbs the execution of code.

Synchronous programming - Execution of next line is completely depend on next line.

Throwable Is supermost lass in exception class hierarchy
		
			    Throwable
Exception-Can be Handled				Error-Difficult to Handle
IOException						StackOverFlow Error
ClassNotFoundException					OutOfMemoryError
SQLException
RunTimeException:
	ArithmeticException
	NullPointerException
	NumberFormatException
	ClassCastException
	InputMismatchException
	IndexOutOfBoundException
		ArrayIndexOutOfBoundEcxeption
		StringIndexOutOfBoundException

All these Contains in java.lang package


Throwable

Important methods:
getMessage()
printStackTrace()
toString()

Two Types
1) Checked - Direct Child of Exception are checked - Checked by compiler
2) Unchecked - Direct Child of RunTimeException are unchecked - Compiler don't know

ArithmeticException
we will get this when Division by zero

NullPointerException
String s = null;
sopln(s.toUpperCase());
when we try to perform a operation in null values then this exception will come

NumberFormatException
If we convert alphanumeric string into a number then this exception
int a = Integer.parseInt("123abc"); ❌
int b = Integer.parseInt("123");✔️

StringIndexOutOfBoundException
Accessing the index which we don't have at all
String s = "Hello"
sop(s.charAt(7));

InputMismatchException
Wrong input type while using Scanner.

IllegalArgumentException
Passing illegal/invalid argument.

IllegalStateException

Method called at wrong time/state.
Example: using iterator incorrectly.

ConcurrentModificationException
Modifying collection while iterating.


To avoid all these exceptions:

Exceptional Handling takes place
1 try - Inside this we should write abnormal statement
2 catch - catch the exception thrown by try block(we can write catch block only with the try block)
3 finally
4 throw
5 throws

printstacktrace method will give the detail information of exception without disturbing the flow

finally - used to write the costly resources
This has to be executed even exception occurs or not

throw - manually throwing exception which is used custom exception which was userdefined.
throws - Declare the exception and Used in method signature Tells caller: “this method may throw exception” and documentation purpose (telling that this method may throw exception)
✅ throws is compulsory for checked exceptions
❌ throws is not compulsory for runtime (unchecked) exceptions like ArithmeticException
throws in main() means:
"If exception occurs, JVM will handle it."

Exception Propagation - One method throws exception to other and other throw to another 



Note: If we extend Exception class then we should declare throws and exception name in method
If we extend runtimeException class then no need this throws declartion
