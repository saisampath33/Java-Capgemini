Passing Reference to method

Helper Method or Factory method

Method Chaining - The process of calling method one after the another by using .
when we can achieve the object reference

Relationships:
To represent the connection between 2 objects same like real world
how classes are connected to each other

HAS-A - Association(Composition/Aggregation)
IS-A - Inheritance


IS-A means “is a type of”

A class inherits another class using the extends keyword.

Car IS-A Vehicle

Dog IS-A Animal

Student IS-A Person

Achieved using inheritance
Uses extends
Supports method overriding
Enables runtime polymorphism

Reusability - Compile time
Coupling - Tight

HAS-A

HAS-A means “has a” or “uses a”

One class contains an object of another class.

Car HAS-A Engine

Student HAS-A Address

Company HAS-A Employees

Achieved using object creation
Uses instance variables - An instance variable in Java is a non-static variable declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block.
More flexible than inheritance
Preferred in real-world applications

Types of HAS-A Relationship

Two forms of association -> aggregation and composition
Aggregation (Weak HAS-A)

Objects can exist independently - College HAS-A Students (Even if college closes, students still exist) and Coupling - LOOSE by lazy loading



Composition (Strong HAS-A)

Objects cannot exist independently - House HAS-A Rooms (If house is destroyed, rooms are destroyed) and Coupling - TIGHT by using early loading


Reusability - Runtime
Coupling - LOOSE
Better Maintainability

Here, One object depends on other and we can achieve this by creating a reference variable for it

One class contains a reference variable
That reference variable points to an object of another class
One class contains reference variable of another class

Both aggregation and composition use reference variables, but aggregation creates objects outside the class, while composition creates objects inside the class.

🔹 If object comes from outside → Aggregation
🔹 If object is born inside → Composition

HAS-A relationship can be achieved in Java by creating a reference variable of one class inside another class.
The object can be created inside the class (composition), passed through a constructor, passed through a setter method (aggregation), or created inside a method. HAS-A relationship can be achieved in Java by creating a reference variable of one class inside another class.
The object can be created inside the class (composition), passed through a constructor, passed through a setter method (aggregation), or created inside a method.


Early instantiation
It means creating an object at the time of reference variable declaration.

In simple words:
Object is created before it is actually needed

We use single line non static initializers

Object is created earlier than required
Created before method execution
Created during class/object initialization

if we want to create multiple objects for example 4 types of car instead of taking 4 variables we can take array of it

Lazy Instantiation

We will only create the object when we need it(later)
Saves memory
Improves performance
Useful for heavy objects (DB, network, files)
Avoids unnecessary object creation.

Creating objects inside method

Lazy instantiation is the process of creating an object only when it is required, instead of creating it at the time of reference variable declaration. It helps in saving memory and improving performance.

class Car {
    Engine eng;   // only reference

    void drive() {
        if (eng == null) {
            eng = new Engine(); // lazy instantiation
        }
        eng.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }
}
