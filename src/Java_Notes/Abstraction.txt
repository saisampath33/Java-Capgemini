Abstraction

1 abstract class -> An abstract class is a partially implemented class that cannot be instantiated
2 interfaces

Hiding the internal details

concrete method = defined(declared) and implementation

incomplete/abstract  method - only method declaration no implementation

abstract class => we can write complete method and abstract method -> we cant create the object of this class as it is incompleted class. we can achieve partial abstraction coz we have both concrete and normal incomplete methods 

interface - Fully abstraction - write only abstract methods - bydefault it is public 
After java 8 - implements key words

Interface → Interface ➜ extends
Class → Interface ➜ implements
Class → Class ➜ extends

We cannot execute the interface like in main method

We can achieve multiple inheritance

we cant create object of interface

non static variables and methods are not allowed in interface
static methods, abstract methods, default methods 
public static final variables are allowed


Functional interface - if interface contains only one abstract method.
