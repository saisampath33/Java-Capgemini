Object Class

In Java, the Object class is the root (parent) class of all classes.
present in java.lang package
11 non static methods in object class
Every class you create in Java automatically extends Object, even if you don’t write it explicitly.

toString();
equals(Object ref)
hashCode()
getClass()
clone()
wait()
wait(long)
wait(int,long)
finalize()
notify()
notifyAll()

toString() is used to return a string representation of an object.
public String toString(){
 	return getClass().getName()+"@"+Integer.toHexaString().hashCode();
}
gives address of any object (This is a converted address)
where toString method implicitly called

we can override this toString

Student s = new Student();
System.out.println(s);   // internally calls s.toString() -> ClassName@HexadecimalHashCode

Rules for toString()

✔ Must return String
✔ No parameters
✔ Access modifier should be public
✔ Annotation @Override is recommended


equals(Object)

Default equals() compares memory addresses, NOT content. It checks Content (if overridden)
== -> checks address of both for primitive data types
CurrentObject.equals(pastObject) //for non primitive data types

HasHcode
hashCode() method returns the hash value of an object (not its memory address). Used heavily in hash-based collections like HashMap, HashSet, etc
Hashcode gives a unique hash value for every object based on their address and if we overrided it we can get same hashcode value same object values
If we check these two hashcode value then it is true same like equals methods it checks content and hashcode checks the integer value is same or not
Instead of generating integer number we can generate the integer number based on states
public int hashCode(){
 	return this.name.hashCode() + age + this.address.hashCode(); //.hashcode() converts String to integer
}


getClass() -> to get the classname and package where the particular object belongs to

finalize() -> finalize() is a method of the Object class that is called by Garbage Collector before an object is destroyed.
Before object is deleted, we may want to:
✔ Close file
✔ Close DB connection
✔ Release memory
That logic can be written in finalize().
