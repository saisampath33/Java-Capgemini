Generics

We can make a collection the generic type like it stores the same data type of INTEGER(Homogenous)

Generics = type safety
They allow you to specify which type of object a collection/class/method should work with.

👉 Instead of storing any type of data, generics restrict it to one specific type.

Generics work only with Wrapper classes (not primitives)
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
