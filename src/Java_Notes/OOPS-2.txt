OOPS-Encapsulation

Any language which supports OOPS principle so it is known OOP language
To design the real world application it is used
Design one type and use it for every object

1)Encapsulation
2)Inheritance
3)Polymorphism
4)Abstraction

Encapsulation

process of wrapping variables(states) and methods(behaviors) in a single unit.
Advantage -> Data Hiding-> Hiding the data using access modifiers (private) -> No one can access this data directly we can access indirectly using methods(getters(Read the data) and setters(Write/Modify the data))

for one property we should have different getter and setter method
java beam class(class contains private data members and public getters and setters) and inner class

Ex
ATM -> atmid,location,money(States) and withdraw(),deposit(), check balance() (Behaviors) ->These all are wrapped in single class to achieve encapsulation

public -> we can use anywhere wherever we want (High visibility and accessibility)
protected -> we can access only in same package (if there is IS-A (Inheritance) relationship then we can access in different package like sub class in another package)
private -> Accessing in same class() (Less visibility and accessibility)
Default -> we can access only inside the same package (if we did not give any access modifier it will be considered)

Static Inner Class
Why Java has Inner Classes?

1️⃣ To logically group related classes
2️⃣ To increase encapsulation
3️⃣ To access private members of outer class
4️⃣ To reduce code clutter

Declared with static
Belongs to class, not object
Can access only static members of outer class
