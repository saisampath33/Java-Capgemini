Collections - Group of classes

										Java Collection Framework (JCF)

										Iterable(Interface) -> Present in java.lang
				
										Collection(Interface) -> From here all are present in java.util

							 List(interface)	 	Set(Interface)				 Queue(Interface)
							 ArrayList		 HashSet	SortedSet(Interface)		 Priority Queue
							 LinkedList		 LinkedHashSet	     TreeSet		 	 Deque(Interface and Child of Queue)
							 Vector			 							ArrayDeque
							    Stack									LinkedList


Linked list is inheriting by two parents so it is multiple inheritance

Iterable

Root interface
Enables for-each loop

Collection

Parent of List, Set, Queue
Basic operations:
add()
addAll() -> adding collection to another collection
remove()
size()
isEmpty()

Inside collection interface -> all methods are present here 

ArrayList implementing class of List Interface

Stores Heterogenous data -> meaning it can store elements of different data types. 
Indexing
Duplicate allowed
We can add null value
Insertion order is there
Fast access

Methods which implement from Collection Interface
//addAll(collection) accept collection type of reference
//add(object) accept Object type of reference

Methods which implement from List Interface
add(index,object)
addAll(index,collection)

Add custom object in collection

Access the element
get -> only in LISTS
for each
Iterator



Iterable(Interface) contains iterator() method -> which is helper method which create object return the refernce

Iterator(Interface) -> next() and hasNext() these both method implementation have in different classes

listname.iterator() -> helps to create object of hasNext() and next() which gives the address of object
To store it
Iterator i = listname.iterator();
i.next() //calling method of child class using parent reference
gives the current element and points to the next element -> next() method
If no element is there in next then NoSuchElementException will come

To avoid this exception
hasNext() ->  return type is Boolean(Checks if the element is there)
If next element is there(By hasNext()) then use next() to print current element


Iterator i = listname.iterator() // here we are converting the whole collection into iterator type where we cant add remove element

This is available for all type of collections

In list hierachy we have  one more iterator that is ListIterator -> only in LIST
We can move forward and backward traversal

In ListIterator
Package: java.util
Type: interface
It extends Iterator

next()
hasNext() -> boolean
previous()
hasPrevious() -> boolean

List interface only has methods which return ListIterator


Collection interface
1 remove(Object)-> Remove element by value
2 remove(index) -> remove(int index) exists in List interface, not in Collection.
3 removeAll(Collection c) -> Removes all elements from current collection that are present in the given collection c. list1.removeAll(list2);
4 retainAll(Collection c) -> Keeps only those elements which are common in both collections.
5 clear() -> Removes everything from the collection.
