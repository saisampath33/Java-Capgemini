Collections - Group of classes

										Java Collection Framework (JCF)

										Iterable(Interface) -> Present in java.lang
				
										Collection(Interface) -> From here all are present in java.util

							 List(interface)	 	Set(Interface)				 Queue(Interface)
							 ArrayList		 HashSet	SortedSet(Interface)		 Priority Queue
							 LinkedList		 LinkedHashSet	     TreeSet		 	 Deque(Interface and Child of Queue)
							 Vector			 							ArrayDeque
							    Stack									LinkedList


Linked list is inheriting by two parents so it is multiple inheritance

Iterable

Root interface
Enables for-each loop

Collection

Parent of List, Set, Queue
Basic operations:
add()
addAll() -> adding collection to another collection
remove()
size()
isEmpty()

Inside collection interface -> all methods are present here 

ArrayList implementing class of List Interface

Stores Heterogenous data -> meaning it can store elements of different data types. 
Indexing
Duplicate allowed
We can add null value
Insertion order is there
Fast access

Methods which implement from Collection Interface
//addAll(collection) accept collection type of reference
//add(object) accept Object type of reference

Methods which implement from List Interface
add(index,object)
addAll(index,collection)



Add custom object in collection
