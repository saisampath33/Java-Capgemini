Comparable Interface

It is functional interface present in java.lang package
Here objects only doing comparison
We should implement this and override the compareTo  method for custom comparing like only comparing id in object



Comparator Interface
Two objects are there third person is comparing two objects
we should pass third person
override cmpare mmethod which internally call compareTo method
java.util package


📌 Comparable = "I can compare myself with others"
📌 Comparator = "I will compare two objects

sort() calls:

compare() → if you use Comparator  -> Integer.compare(a, b);, Double.compare(a, b); -> input and output both are primitive no conversion needed
compareTo() → if you use Comparable -> Only we can use with wrapper classes we cannot do it with primitive

Collections.sort() -> Collections only
Arrays.sort() -> Normal static array

| Feature                    | `compareTo()`                                  | `compare()`                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Belongs to                 | `Comparable` interface                         | `Comparator` interface                  |
| Purpose                    | Defines **natural ordering** of a class        | Defines **custom / multiple orderings** |
| Implemented in             | The class itself (e.g., `Student`, `Employee`) | Separate class (or lambda)              |
| Method signature           | `int compareTo(T o)`                           | `int compare(T o1, T o2)`               |
| Number of objects compared | Compares **this** with one object              | Compares **two external objects**       |
| How many sorting rules     | Only ONE                                       | Can have MANY                           |
| Used when                  | Class has a single default sort logic          | You need flexible sorting               |
| Example                    | Sort Employee by ID                            | Sort Book by price / title              |
| Sorting call               | `Collections.sort(list)`                       | `Collections.sort(list, comparator)`    |
| Primitive support          | Needs wrapper (`Integer`, `Double`)            | Usually uses `Integer.compare()` etc    |
| Modifies class?            | YES                                            | NO                                      |
| Real-world analogy         | Default behavior                               | External strategy                       |


Using Comparable → compareTo()

Inside class:

class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    public int compareTo(Student s) {
        return this.marks - s.marks;
    }
}

Sorting:

Collections.sort(list);

👉 Only ONE rule possible.
🔹 Using Comparator → compare()

Separate class:

class PriceComparator implements Comparator<Book> {
    public int compare(Book b1, Book b2) {
        return Double.compare(b1.getPrice(), b2.getPrice());
    }
}

Sorting:

Collections.sort(list, new PriceComparator());

👉 Multiple rules allowed.
