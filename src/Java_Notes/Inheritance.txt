Inheritance

One class acquiring the properties of another class
The one class whose properties are inherited by anther is parent,base class
the class which inherits is child class

extends -> 2 classes or 2 interfaces
implements -> 1 class and 1 interface ->for a IS-A relationship then interface is parent and class is child

static members
class A{
	static int a;
	p s v method1(){
	s o pln("Parent");
	}
}
class B extends A{
	p s v main(){
	s o pln(a);
	method1(); //This will work Class A members also there in class B
	}
}

if there is extends keyword no need to give classname as reference to call only static variable or method. We can directly call it

These can be inherited
static members - variables , methods
non static members - variables , methods 

These cannot be inherited
static members - intializers
non static members - initializers and constructors

super() call statement we can call constructors from parent class used to initialize parent members from child class constructor
super keyword - when parent and child class has same identifiers we can differentiate by the super keyword 
 
5 types

Single Level - Having only one parent class and one child class
Multilevel - Having more than one level of inheritance
Hierarchal - One parent multiple childs
Multiple - One child Multiple parents not possible by classes
Hybrid 

we can achieve non primitive type casting if it is a IS-A relationship

Casting = converting one type of reference into another type

upcasting -> The process of converting child type of reference into the parent type(compiler will do implicitly) Also called implicit casting
downcasting -> The process of converting parent type of reference into the child type(lossy conversion) It is explicit casting
we should type cast operator
Without Upcasting we cant do the downcasting

Upcasting and Downcasting deal ONLY with object references
instanceOf operator return Boolean
