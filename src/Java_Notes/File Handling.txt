File Handling

To store the data in file for permenant use
Data will store in form of strings
package is java.io

filereader and bufferreader
filewriter and bufferwriter

FileReader is a class used to read character data from a file.

Reads one character at a time
Used for text files
Slower if file is large (because char-by-char reading)

FileReader fr = new FileReader("sample.txt");
int ch;
while((ch = fr.read()) != -1){
    System.out.print((char)ch);
}
fr.close();

fr.read() returns:
an int representing ASCII/Unicode character
-1 means end of file (EOF)

BufferedReader reads text from a file efficiently by storing data in a buffer.

Faster than FileReader
Can read line by line
Best for big files

BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("sample.txt"));
String line;
while((line = br.readLine()) != null){
    System.out.println(line);
}
br.close();

readLine() returns:
one full line
null means end of file

FileWriter is used to write text data into a file.

Writes character data
Can overwrite / append

✅ Syntax (Overwrite mode)
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("sample.txt");

✅ Overwrites file content.



✅ Syntax
FileReader fr = new FileReader("sample.txt");
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("file.txt", append);
true means APPEND
new FileWriter("error.txt", true);


📌 Meaning:
✅ Add new text at the end of the file
✅ Do NOT delete old data

false means OVERWRITE
new FileWriter("error.txt", false);


📌 Meaning:
❌ Clears file first
✅ Writes fresh new data

new FileWriter(filePath, false).close();
Meaning:
✅ Open file in overwrite mode (clears it)
✅ Close immediately
✅ file becomes EMPTY


What is BufferedWriter?

BufferedWriter improves performance by writing text using a buffer.

Faster writing than FileWriter
Best for large content writing
Supports newLine() method

BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("sample.txt"));
bw.write("Hello");
bw.newLine();
bw.write("World");
bw.close();
