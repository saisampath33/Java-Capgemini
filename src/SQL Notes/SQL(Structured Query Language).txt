SQL(Structured Query Language)
Sequel -> SQL
It is a language used to communicate/interact with databases for
1 -> Store the data
2 -> Fetching(Take Back) the data
Data -> Collection of information -> Raw fact

The 	colour	 	of a 	marker    is 	black
 	properties/features	object		data->raw fact

object -> real time world existence(It should be definable and describable).
Data is raw fact(original) which describes the attributes(properties) of the entity(Object).

Entity
It is a object either living thing or non living thing
Anything which has physical existence in a real world is known as entity

Database - Place, Medium, Container
To store the data's in a systematic and organized manner.
In database we can perform several operations(tasks)
Create/Insert
Read/Retrieve
Update/Modify
Delete/Drop

CRUD operations

DBMS - Data Base Management System

It is a software which is used to maintain and manage the database.
It consists of two important features
Security
Authorization
In DBMS we can store the data's in the form of files/folders
We are using query language to communicate with dbms

Based on the data stored in DBMS, It has 4 classifications

HDBMS - Hierarchical		   -> 	DL/I(Data language/Interface)
NDBMS - Network(Node Connectivity) ->   CODASYL DML
OODMS - object oriented 	   -> 	OQL(Object Query Language)
RDMS -  Relational		   -> 	SQL
Except RDBMS others are very complex
We want exact schema which is pre definable for RDBMS
NoSQL(MongoDB) - No need of schema

Relational Model
Designed by Eggert Franklin codd

To store data in rows and columns (Tabular Data)
DBMS + Rules of EF codd(Relational Model) = RDBMS

RDBMS is a type of DBMS software which is used to maintain the manages the database
We are SQL to communicate with RDBMS

Table is a logical organization of rows and cols
Rows -> Records, Tuples
Cols -> Attributes
Cells -> Smallest unit or a block in a table which is used to store the data or intersection of rows and cols

Meta data
Details about the data
This meta data's are stored in a table called meta table which are auto-generated
Metadata is "data about data," providing descriptive information that helps organize, find, use, and manage other data, like an author and creation date for a document, or size and resolution for an image, giving context to raw information and making systems more efficient


EF Codd Rules
Data Entering into a cell must be a single valued data(atomic data). If it is multi valued we face data loses
In RDBMS, we can store everything in form of tables including meta data
In RDBMS, we can store data's in multiple tables if it is needed by making a connection between the tables with the help of key attributes(Common Cols)
In RDBMS, we can validate the data by two steps
 	By assigning datatypes to a column
 	By assigning constraints to a column
    Data types are mandatory constraints are optional

no space in table name we can use _ in it

Data Types

It describes the type of data should be storing into a particular column or a memory location
Char
Varchar
Date
Number
Large object
Character Large object
Binary Large object

CHAR:
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, Special character, Alpha numeric
Characters are enclosed within single qoutations ' '
syntax - char(size);
The maximum size is 2000characters
It follows fixed length of memory allocation
Note: In char datatype un-used memory are wastage of memories

Varchar:
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, Special character, Alpha numeric
Characters are enclosed within single qoutations ' '
syntax - varchar(size);
It can accept upto 2000 characters
It follows variable length of memory allocation
Note: In varchar unused memories are return back to the main memory

Varchar2:
It is a updated version of varchar
syntax - varchar2(size);
It follows variable length of memory allocation
It can accept upto 4000 characters

DATE:
stores/accepts only date

Oracle format DD-MM-YYYY

Number:

Store numerical values
Accept two arguments

precision (p) → total number of digits allowed
scale (s) → number of digits after the decimal point

Precision is mandatory scale is optional

scale>=precison
if(scale<=precision) then precison job will taken by scale

Syntax Number(precision,[scale])
[]-> operand

Precision - It is used to allocate number of digits required for storing a integer values The range of precision is 1 to 38
Scale - It is used to store decimal values within the given precision. The range of scale is -84 to 127 default value is 0

Ex:
salary NUMBER(5,2) -> Total digits allowed = 5, Decimal digits allowed = 2
Valid:
123.45
999.99
12.3
1.23

age NUMBER(3,0)
Valid:
1
99
999

NUMBER(3,5) precision<scale -> NUMBER(3,5) is invalid in Oracle because scale cannot be greater than precision.
.00999

What does negative scale mean?

When scale is negative:
Oracle rounds the number to the left of the decimal point.

scale = -n  →  rounding happens to 10ⁿ

NUMBER(5,-3)
col NUMBER(5,-3)

Precision = 5 (total digits)
Scale = -3 → rounding to thousands (1000) if -2 then rounding in 100s

Valid values & stored result

Inserted value	Stored value
12345		12000
99999		100000
4567		5000
1000		1000
Rounded to nearest 1000


Large Objects

Character Large Objects

It is used to store huge amount of characters upto 4GB of size
syntax - CLOB

Binary Large Objects

It is used to store the binary values of photo, video, audio etc upto 4GB
Syntax - BLOB

Constraints

These are the rules or conditions which are assigned to a column for a validation

Types

Unique - It is a constraint which cannot accept duplicate or repeated values.

Not Null - It is a constraint which cannot accept NULL values (Null - empty cell and it cannot occupies any memory space & 0 cannot be a null & if we perform any arthimetic task against the null it returns null ex 100 + null = null)

Check - It gives extra validation with the help of conditions. If condition get satisfied the data get enters into a column or else it rejects the data
 	Ex: Check(Length(PhoneNumber) = 10)
 	Check(column name operator value/data)

Primary Key

It is used to identify the unique records from the table

Characteristics of primary key

We have only one primary key in a table
It cannot accepts duplicate or repeated values
It cannot accept NULL values
It is a combination of both unique and not null constraints.
It is not mandatory but it is highly recommended to use in table


Foreign Key

It is used to make connection between the tables

Characteristics of foreign key

We have n number of foreign keys in a table
It can accept duplicate or repeated values
It can accept NULL values
It is not a combination of both unique and not null constraints.
To become a foreign key it must be primary key in its own table
foreign key present in a child table but it actually belongs to parent table
It also known as referential integrity constraints

SQL CRUD

DDL (Data Definition language)     -> (Create,Rename,Alter,Truncate,Drop)
DML (Data Manipulation language)   -> (Insert,Update,Delete)
TCL (Transaction Control Language) -> (Commit->Rollback,Savepoint->Rollbackto)
DCL (Data Control language)        -> (Grant,Revoke)
DQL (Data Query language)          -> (SELECT,Projection,Selection,Joins)

DQL
Retrieve or Fetching the data's from the table
Statements of DQL -> (SELECT,Projection,Selection,Joins)

SELECT
It is used to retrieving the data from the table and display it

Projection
It is used to retrieving the data from the table by selecting only the cols
if the columns are get selected by default the values present in a column also get selected

Selection
It is used to retrieving the data from table by selecting both rows & cols
Syntax: Select */DISTINCT column name /Expression [Alias] from table_name where <filter condition>;

Joins
Used to retrieving the data from multiple table simultaneously

Distinct: It is used to fetch the unique data which means it ignores the duplicate values while displaying the data
Incase of multiple columns with distinct it checks weather all the columns are same or not
Unique: It will not allow the data while entering the data into the table only means while creating.


Expression:

Any statement which gives result is called Expression
2. It is the combination of operators and operands

Operands: it can be either column names or value

Operators: Predefined symbols used to perform specific task

Alias

Alias is the alternative name given to a column name or expression present in the result table

Order of execution

from
where --> row by row
select

Where clause
It is used to filter the records from the table with help of conditions
In where clause we can use filter condition as a argument
<colm name/expression operator value/data> ---> filter condition
Where clause executes after the from clause
It executes row by row
In where clause we can write multiple conditions with the help of logical operators (AND,OR, NOT)
It return Boolean values


Operators:
It is a predefined symbols used to perform a specific task

Arithmetic Operator(+, -, /, *)
Concatenation Operator
Comparison Operator (=, != or <>)
Relational Operator (<, >, <=, >=)
Logical Operator: (AND, OR, NOT)
Special Operator: (IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN,NOT BETWEEN,IS,IS NOT,LIKE,NOT LIKE)
Subquery Operators: (ALL,ANY,EXISTS,NOT EXISTS)

Concatenation Operator
It is used to join or merge given strings
Symbol - ||


Logical Operators

It is used to write more than one conditions in a where clause
And - Binary multiplication operator it return true if all given conditions are correct
OR - Binary addition operator

IN - similar to equals operator

It is a multi valued operator
Can accept multiple values in a RHS which belongs to the same column
It return true if atleast any one of a condition gets satisfied
Used instead of writing multiple OR's

column name/expression IN (v1,v2.v3,...........vn)

NOT IN
It is a similar to IN operator instead of selecting the values it rejects the multiple values
column name/expression NOT IN (v1,v2.v3,...........vn)

BETWEEN IN
