SQL(Structured Query Language)
Sequel -> SQL
It is a language used to communicate/interact with databases for
1 -> Store the data
2 -> Fetching(Take Back) the data
Data -> Collection of information -> Raw fact

The 	colour	 	of a 	marker    is 	black
	properties/features	object		data->raw fact

object -> real time world existence(It should be definable and describable).
Data is raw fact(original) which describes the attributes(properties) of the entity(Object).

Entity
It is a object either living thing or non living thing
Anything which has physical existence in a real world is known as entity

Database - Place, Medium, Container
To store the data's in a systematic and organized manner.
In database we can perform several operations(tasks) 
Create/Insert
Read/Retrieve
Update/Modify
Delete/Drop

CRUD operations

DBMS - Data Base Management System

It is a software which is used to maintain and manage the database.
It consists of two important features
Security
Authorization
In DBMS we can store the data's in the form of files/folders
We are using query language to communicate with dbms

Based on the data stored in DBMS, It has 4 classifications

HDBMS - Hierarchical		   -> 	DL/I(Data language/Interface)
NDBMS - Network(Node Connectivity) ->   CODASYL DML
OODMS - object oriented 	   -> 	OQL(Object Query Language)
RDMS -  Relational		   -> 	SQL
Except RDBMS others are very complex
We want exact schema which is pre definable for RDBMS
NoSQL(MongoDB) - No need of schema

Relational Model
Designed by Eggert Franklin codd

To store data in rows and columns (Tabular Data)
DBMS + Rules of EF codd(Relational Model) = RDBMS

RDBMS is a type of DBMS software which is used to maintain the manages the database
We are SQL to communicate with RDBMS

Table is a logical organization of rows and cols
Rows -> Records, Tuples
Cols -> Attributes
Cells -> Smallest unit or a block in a table which is used to store the data or intersection of rows and cols

Meta data
Details about the data
This meta data's are stored in a table called meta table which are auto-generated
Metadata is "data about data," providing descriptive information that helps organize, find, use, and manage other data, like an author and creation date for a document, or size and resolution for an image, giving context to raw information and making systems more efficient


EF Codd Rules
Data Entering into a cell must be a single valued data(atomic data). If it is multi valued we face data loses
In RDBMS, we can store everything in form of tables including meta data
In RDBMS, we can store data's in multiple tables if it is needed by making a connection between the tables with the help of key attributes(Common Cols)
In RDBMS, we can validate the data by two steps 
	By assigning datatypes to a column
	By assigning constraints to a column 
    Data types are mandatory constraints are optional

Data Types

It describes the type of data should be storing into a particular column or a memory location
Char
Varchar
Date
Number
Large object
Character Large object
Binary Large object

CHAR:
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, Special character, Alpha numeric
Characters are enclosed within single qoutations ' '
syntax - char(size);
The maximum size is 2000characters 
It follows fixed length of memory allocation
Note: In char datatype un-used memory are wastage of memories

Varchar:
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, Special character, Alpha numeric
Characters are enclosed within single qoutations ' '
syntax - varchar(size);
It can accept upto 2000 characters
It follows variable length of memory allocation
Note: In varchar unused memories are return back to the main memory

Varchar2:
It is a updated version of varchar
syntax - varchar2(size);
It follows variable length of memory allocation
It can accept upto 4000 characters

DATE:

Oracle format DD-MM-YYYY

Number:

Accept two arguments
Precision is mandatory scale is optional
Syntax Number(precision,[scale])
[]-> operand
